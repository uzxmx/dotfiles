Wrapper for aliyun utility.

You need to use 'profile' subcommand to add a profile before using other
subcommands.

When there exists several profiles, you have three ways to decide which one to
use:

The first way is to specify 'ALIYUN_PROFILE' as an environment variable.

The second way is to specify both 'ALIYUN_ACCESS_KEY_ID' and
'ALIYUN_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET' as environment variables.

The third way is to use 'profile use' command to set a defaul profile.

Subcommands:
  p, profile         - manage profiles
  d, dns             - manage DNS
  sg, security_group - manage security groups
  c, cdn             - manage CDN
  e, ecs             - manage elastic compute service
  v, vpc             - manage virtual private cloud
  n, nat             - manage NAT gateways
  o, oss             - manage OSS (Object Storage Service)

  exit 1
